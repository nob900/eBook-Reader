# eBook-Reader

This application is a not-full-featured eBook Reader for Firefox OS.

It is almost perfect for reading eBooks (ePUB files) generated from Web contents using [Calibre eBook converter](http://www.calibre-ebook.com) but will probably fail reading other files.

It has some (many) limitations. For example, it's not possible to switch to next chapter once you reached the end of current one. It's more a reader for articles than a reader for books.

# Application template

It's the first application based on my [Firefox OS application template](https://gitlab.com/snobili/FxOS-App-Template).
